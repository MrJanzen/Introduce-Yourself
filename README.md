# Introduce-Yourself

Edit this README file and tell me a little bit about yourself.

1. Why are you taking comp sci 30?

2. What do you plan on doing after high school?

3. What do you feel will be your biggest challenge in CS30?

4. What do you like to do in your spare time?

When you are done editing the file, scroll down and click commit the changes. 
Make sure "Commit directly to the main branch" is selected. (It should be...)
This will save the changes and Mr. Janzen can take a look at your answers.
